Parameter "macstr" is read from HTTP request into $v0. Parameter "bandstr" is read from HTTP request into $v0_1.

Stack variable var_120 is constructed using sprintf and used as paramter of `system()` at 0x459570.

When "macstr" or "bandstr" has carefully crafted payload (e.g. `;ls;`, `` `ls` ``), this would result a command injection vulnerability.
