# Detail

`sub_449040` (handle function of formUploadFile) of /bin/boa in firmware has command injection vulnerability.

After validation of `Content-Type` and `filename` parameter with sub_4482d8() (checkFileFormat in picture), sub_448b70() is called using 0x48e4b0 as 4th paramter.

Due to a [buffer overflow on BSS segment](https://github.com/unpWn4bL3/iot-security/blob/main/27.md), we could overflow to 0x48ed90 and write arbitray content. Stack variable var_218 is constructed using sprintf and used as paramter of system() at 0x448c5c.

When 0x48ed90 has carefully crafted payload (e.g. ;ls;, `ls`), this would result a command injection vulnerability.
