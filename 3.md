# Detail

`sub_452f94` (handle function of formIpv6Setup) of /bin/boa in firmware has multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

## 0x453448

Parameter "static_ipv6" is read from HTTP request into $v0_32, then copied to stack variable var_78. When "static_ipv6" has excessive length, this would result an stack buffer overflow.

Parameter "static_gw" is read from HTTP request into $v0_33, then copied to stack variable var_b8. When "static_gw" has excessive length, this would result an stack buffer overflow.

## 0x4530ac

arg2 is assigned to $s2, stack parameter var_120 is constructed using sprintf. When arg2 has excessive length, this would result an stack buffer overflow.

## 0x4534b8

Parameter "static_dns1" is read from HTTP request and copied to stack variable var_f8. When "static_dns1" has excessive length, this would result an stack buffer overflow.

## 0x453548

![image](https://github.com/unpWn4bL3/iot-security/assets/13286957/0c97bc79-b5d0-4ff9-8b3c-492d5bd3adf7)

Parameter "pppoe_dns1" is read from HTTP request and copied to stack variable var_f8. When "pppoe_dns1" has excessive length, this would result an stack buffer overflow.

## 0x453580

![image](https://github.com/unpWn4bL3/iot-security/assets/13286957/e08fde00-8b14-439d-85d1-77ad6a6b09b9)

Parameter "dhcp_dns1" is read from HTTP request and copied to stack variable var_f8. When "pppoe_dns1" has excessive length, this would result an stack buffer overflow.

## 0x4534d8

![image](https://github.com/unpWn4bL3/iot-security/assets/13286957/b330859d-bd13-455f-b12c-436a98f5589c)

Parameter "static_dns2"/"pppoe_dns2"/"dhcp_dns2" is read from HTTP request and copied to stack variable var_138. When "static_dns2"/"pppoe_dns2"/"dhcp_dns2" has excessive length, this would result an stack buffer overflow.
