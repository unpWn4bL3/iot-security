# Detail

`sub_4163AC` (handle function of formPortFw) of /bin/boa in firmware has multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

## 0x4164dc

Parameter "service_type" is read from HTTP request into $v0_5, then copied to stack variable var_b1. When "service_type" has excessive length, this would result an stack buffer overflow.

## 0x4166dc

Parameter "ip_subnet" is read from HTTP request into $v0_27. Parameter "fw_ip" is read from HTTP request into $v0_28.

Stack variable var_74 is constructed using sprintf. When "ip_subnet" or "fw_ip" has excessive length, this would result an stack buffer overflow.

## 0x416b8c

Parameter "submit_url" is read from HTTP request into $s2_7

$s2_7 is used as 2nd parameter in sub_40bddc at 0x416b8c

arg2 is assigned to $s2, stack variable var_120 is constructed using sprintf. When arg2 has excessive length, this would result an stack buffer overflow.

# PoC

I'm not able to provide full exploit for this vulnerability due to legal reasons.
