# Detail

`sub_4594C0` (handle function of formMapDelDevice) of /bin/boa in firmware has multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

## 0x459604

Parameter "hostname" is read from HTTP request into $v0_8, then copied to stack variable var_74. When "hostname" has excessive length, this would result an stack buffer overflow.

## 0x459560

Parameter "macstr" is read from HTTP request into $v0. Parameter "bandstr" is read from HTTP request into $v0_1.

Stack variable var_120 is constructed using sprintf. When "macstr" or "bandstr" has excessive length, this would result an stack buffer overflow.

## 0x45959c

arg2 is assigned to $s2, stack variable var_120 is constructed using sprintf. When arg2 has excessive length, this would result an stack buffer overflow.
