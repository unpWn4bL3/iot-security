Parameter "submit_url" is read from HTTP request into $s2_1

$s2_1 is used as 2nd parameter in sub_40bddc at 0x417be8

arg2 is assigned to $s2, stack variable var_120 is constructed using sprintf. When arg2 has excessive length, this would result an stack buffer overflow.

## 0x4175a4

Parameter "vpnUser" is read from HTTP request into $v0_105, then copied to stack variable var_2c8. When "vpnUser" has excessive length, this would result an stack buffer overflow.

## 0x4175d0

Parameter "vpnPassword" is read from HTTP request into $v0_106, then copied to stack variable var_295. When "vpnPassword" has excessive length, this would result an stack buffer overflow.
