# Detail

`sub_41AC3C` (handle function of formIpQoS) of /bin/boa in firmware has multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

## 0x41af40

Parameter "mac" is read from HTTP request into $v0_16, then copied to stack variable var_110. When "mac" has excessive length, this would result an stack buffer overflow.

## 0x41c778

arg2 is assigned to $s2, stack variable var_120 is constructed using sprintf. When arg2 has excessive length, this would result an stack buffer overflow.

# PoC

I'm not able to provide full exploit for this vulnerability due to legal reasons.
